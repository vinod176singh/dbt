Would you like to now focus on CI/CD deployment with dbt, automate tests in a scheduler (like Airflow), or build advanced macros?

1. Jinja Macros â€“ Build Reusable Logic
Goal: Create custom macros to simplify repetitive logic (like dynamic partition filters, common WHERE conditions, or surrogate keys).

POC: Build a macro to dynamically filter a table by run_date and apply it across multiple models.

Bonus: Try using loop and if inside macros with set() variables.

2. DBT Packages â€“ Modularize Logic
Goal: Create your own DBT package or import a community package like dbt_expectations.

POC: Build a reusable package for transformations used across multiple projects (like common dimension models).

Tip: Try using dbt-utils with generate_surrogate_key, star, and pivot macros.

3. Source Freshness Checks
Goal: Automate data freshness validations.

POC: Define freshness checks on raw sources and schedule dbt source freshness run.

Use this in combination with your data quality logs to alert if upstream sources are stale.

4. Logging & Audit Models
Goal: Track metadata like model execution time, row counts, test results.

POC: Create a model that logs metadata from dbt run-results.json and dbt artifacts.

Push this into a monitoring dashboard (Power BI, Tableau, or even a downstream Snowflake table).

5. Dynamic Model Generation (dbt + Jinja)
Goal: Create models based on config files or metadata.

POC: Use YAML/JSON files or seed tables to dynamically generate models (e.g., build 5 dimension models with same logic using loop over seed).

6. Use dbt Artifacts Programmatically
Goal: Extract metadata from manifest.json and run_results.json.

POC: Build an analysis report on success/failure trends of models/tests across runs.

Use Python or dbt built-in commands to extract these.

7. Multi-environment Strategy
Goal: Set up and test separate dev/qa/prod environments using target and profiles.yml.

POC: Test running the same models in different schemas/databases based on target.

Helps before CI/CD setup.

âœ… Suggested Next Steps:
1. ðŸ“„ Seeds
Load static reference data from CSV files

Example: country codes, region mappings, thresholds

Hands-on: Create a data/ folder, add CSV, define in dbt_project.yml, and run dbt seed

2. ðŸ“Š Analysis
Create shareable SQL blocks for data analysts

Not materialized in the warehouse â€” just reusable queries

Hands-on: Create a .sql file in analysis/, use ref() inside, run via dbt compile

3. ðŸ“¸ Snapshots
Capture slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2)

Useful for tracking historical changes (e.g., customer tier)

Hands-on: Create a snapshots/ folder, define unique_key, strategy, run with dbt snapshot

Data Quality Checks Framework with DBT Tests
Goal: Build reusable test coverage across bronze â†’ silver â†’ gold layers
Key Components:

schema.yml tests (e.g., not_null, unique, accepted_values)

Custom generic test: e.g., valid_email_format.sql

Test results reporting: dbt test + Slack/email notifications (optional)

âœ… POC 2: Incremental Models with Late Arriving Data
Goal: Handle data that arrives late or needs deduplication
Key Components:

materialized='incremental' model

is_incremental() logic with timestamps

DBT macros for managing watermarks

Logging of inserted vs updated rows

âœ… POC 3: Golden Layer Metrics Model + dbt_utils + Exposures
Goal: Build an analytics-ready table + document BI dependencies
Key Components:

Use ref() across layers to create a gold.customer_metrics table

Integrate dbt_utils macros (e.g., surrogate_key, date_spine)

Define exposures: (BI dashboards or Power BI/Tableau dependency)
